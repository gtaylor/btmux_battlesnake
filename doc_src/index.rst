Battlesnake
===========

Battlesnake is a Softcode_ supplement/replacement bot for BattletechMUX_.

The typical BattletechMUX_ requires numerous complex systems to function. For
example:

* Mech ref libararies
* Economic simulations
* Stores for purchasing/selling commodities and parts
* Player stat tracking
* Bulletin board systems

While these have all been successfully built and maintained in softcode,
maintenance and future expansion can be very slow. Softcode_ is a poor choice
for larger systems.

There are also things that can't be done in-game without the help of
hardcode modifications or logfile workarounds:

* Sending emails
* Communication with arbitrary databases/data stores
* Web-based character creation
* Integration with messenger services
* Utilization of social media

Battlesnake aims to supplement or replace large chunks of softcode in your game,
while also opening up any external services you'd like to use.
